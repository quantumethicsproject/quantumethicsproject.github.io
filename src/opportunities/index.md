## Are you interested in getting involved in real quantum research and furthering your career in quantum technolody? Are you a research mentor with a project in need of a student research assistant? 

## The Quantum Ethics Project wants to connect you and foster opportunities for students with diverse backgrounds. The Quantum Ethics Project recognizes the value of investing in the future and ensuring the quantum community looks like the world we are hoping to benefit with quantum tech. 

## We are piloting this program with our first cohort of 6 diverse quantum novices spanning 4 continents is now actively engaged their first research project - [Click Here for the Extended Abstract]([default.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CyrzJ3yxJQgD_HWeTGtjnJG-r1yGwV4HQjBlPBIzDnI/edit)) supported by the Quantum Ethics Project.
